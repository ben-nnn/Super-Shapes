//purpose of this script was to try and have a universal try again button and this script would recieve the previous scene's index from the script "savingSceneIndex" and then go to that scene.
//it would be linked on a button so the button had the index of the previous scene on it so it would go back to the level the user was previously on and try it again.
//couldnt get to work in time.
